              <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
              <p>I'm a DevOps Engineer at SAP, passionate about cloud infrastructure and automation. With a background in system integration and a love for open source, I bridge the gap between development and operations while embracing agile methodologies.</p>
              
              <h3 class="subsection-heading">What I Do</h3>
              <p>At SAP, I focus on Infrastructure as Data using Crossplane and establish Kanban workflows in Jira. I manage cloud-native observability with Grafana and Dynatrace, and help operate Cloud Foundry instances. I'm also an Early Talent Ambassador, helping to enable young talent through events and knowledge sessions.</p>

              <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tech Stack</h3>
              <p>My toolkit includes Go for cloud-native development, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and various observability tools. I'm experienced with both cloud platforms like Azure and traditional Linux systems. My development environment revolves around macOS with tools like VSCode, tmux, iterm2 and docker for enhanced productivity.</p>

              <h3 class="subsection-heading">Beyond Code</h3>
              <p>When I'm not automating infrastructure, you'll find me at the local indoor bouldering gym or designing 3D-printable objects in Fusion360. I run my own Kubernetes homelab using k3s, complete with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD - it's actually hosting this website! This hands-on approach helps me stay current with cloud-native technologies.</p>
              
              <h3 class="subsection-heading">Learning Journey</h3>
              <p>Currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at FOM while working full-time, I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge. My journey from system integration to DevOps has taught me that the best systems are built through collaboration and creativity.</p>
